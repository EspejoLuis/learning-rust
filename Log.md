# October 2025

## ‚òÄÔ∏è 24th October - Friday

- Video: watching video from Jane Street -> [Rust for Everyone!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0dP-QR5wQo&t=542s):
  1. *Learning*:
        - Very interesting website to see visually the concept of `ownership` -> [Acqascope](https://cel.cs.brown.edu/aquascope/). In Aquascope you have ownership concept representation and also very useful representation of stack/heap variables.
        - There is also a link to a modified version of [The Rust Programming Language - Brown Version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/). This version containes quizzes and more graphs to help with understanding of rust.
  2. *Trait Debugger*:
        - [Argus](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/argus). Can be useful I think, to try. IDE plugin.
  3. *A Program Slicer*:
        - [Flowistry](https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry). IDE pluging that highlights part of the code that impacts/are impacted by the variable you are pointing at.

- Checking some website:
  - [getcracked.io](https://getcracked.io/questions). Seems good (also for Python/C++)
  - This guy is good!

## ‚òÄÔ∏è 25th October - Saturday

- It's always good to start from what <u>not to do</u> (Taleb would be so proud!), found some videos:
  - üé• Video [5 things I wish I knew before learning Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYCBm0xAWow&list=PLrAjGqHG72ioGO2OZFQCnKloyDj7jFURl):
    - Some interesting points:
      - Topics to refresh:
        - Heap, stack and dynamic memory.
        - Memory allocation and deallocation.
        - Manual memory management vs garbage collector.
        - Concurrency, parallelism and multithreading.
        - Compiled vs interpreted languages.
      - Suggesting to have prior experience in C/C++. I think yeah it would definitely help but I dont think it's a blocker. He suggests that learning C/C++ could make understanding easier. So it could be useful to always think in terms of what Rust is doing differently from C/C++. Not going to spend too much time in learning C/C++ at the beginning.
      - Suggests some links:
        - [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) in youtube for C/C++ fundamentals.
        - [The Rust Language Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX9HJsJUDxA&list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8&index=1). This can be quite useful. Basically he goes through each chapter of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html) book which is quite cool. It can be used wrap up *after* reading the book.
        - [Rust by Examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html). Series of exercises.
        - Useful repo for practising: [Rustlings repo](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/).
        - Another useful repo that contains articles, best practices, books, workshops: [Idiomatic](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust?tab=readme-ov-file).
        - Recommended also youtube channel [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo) for more advance stuff. Seems cool!
    - Overall good video telling you where to find information!

  - üé• Video [How NOT to learn Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uY5tpcs3Gs&list=PLrAjGqHG72ioGO2OZFQCnKloyDj7jFURl&index=6):
    - Not trying to learn everything at once. Learn enought that you can start practising. After some videos and books there has to be practice.

  - üé• Video [How to Learn Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hXNd6x9sZs&list=PLrAjGqHG72ioGO2OZFQCnKloyDj7jFURl&index=9):
    - Basically [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/) follows the chapter in the [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html). Also [Rust by Examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) is loosely linked to the content of the book. Video suggests to keep them all together.
    - He suggested what I was already thinking, read the book twice without doing any exercise, simply to go through it. The second time use the [The Rust Programming Language - Brown Version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/).
    - It suggest to read Haskel for having a functional view on programming:
      - "Real World Haskell: Code You Can Believe in"
      - "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!: A Beginner's Guide: A Beginner's Guide to Haskell". This seems very basic. Maybe good.

‚úèÔ∏è Summary:

- Read the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) maybe one time, fast, view of all could be helpful.

- Review some topics/concepts.

- Install [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/) --> Done.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è 26th October - Sunday

- Starting reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) very fast and mindmapping it as well (just main chapters). Reached chapter 13.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è 27th October - Monday

- Fast read till chapter 20. Just two left.

## üìö To Do

- [ ] Read book twice.
- [ ] Start using Rustling.
- [ ] Acquascope for ownership concept/stack/heap.
- [ ] Rust by example.
- [ ] Refresh topics:

  - [ ] Heap, stack and dynamic memory
  - [ ] Memory allocation and deallocation
  - [ ] Manual memory management vs garbage collector
  - [ ] Concurrency, parallelism and multithreading
  - [ ] Compiled vs interpreted languages
