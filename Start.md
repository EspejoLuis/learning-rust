- Video: watching video from Jane Street -> [Rust for Everyone!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0dP-QR5wQo&t=542s):
  1. *Learning*:
        - Very interesting website to see visually the concept of `ownership` -> [Acqascope](https://cel.cs.brown.edu/aquascope/). In Aquascope you have ownership concept representation and also very useful representation of stack/heap variables.
        - There is also a link to a modified version of [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/). This version containes quizzes and more graphs to help with understanding of rust.
  2. *Trait Debugger*:
        - [Argus](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/argus). Can be useful I think, to try. IDE plugin.
  3. *A Program Slicer*:
        - [Flowistry](https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry). IDE pluging that highlights part of the code that impacts/are impacted by the variable you are pointing at.

- Checking some website:
  - [getcracked.io](https://getcracked.io/questions). Seems good (also for Python/C++)
  - This guy is good!
