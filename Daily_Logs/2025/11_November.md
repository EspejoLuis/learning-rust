### Chapter 2 - Programming a Guessing Game

- The Chapter gives a first overview, nothing major. It opens many doors but all will be explained in next chapters.

- Variables are immutable by default, so to declare a mutable variable, need to be specific:

  ```rust
  let mut guess = String::new()
  ```

- `read_line` returns a `result`. `result` is an enumeration, i.e. a type that can be in multiple possible states. Each state is called `variant`.

  ```rust
  io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
  ```

  In this case, `result` has two possible `variants`:
  - `Ok` -> operation succeeds and result contains the result of the operation.
  - `Err` -> operation fails and it contains all info about the failure.

- `crate` *is a collection of Rust source code files.*

- Process when we add a dependency in `[dependencies]`:
  - 0️⃣ Terminal: `cargo build` (or any `cargo` command).
  - 1️⃣ Checks the local cache (inside ~/.cargo/registry) to see if it already has that crate version.
  - 2️⃣ If not found, it contacts crates.io (the central registry) and fetches metadata (like versions and dependency trees).
  - 3️⃣ It then downloads all needed crates that aren’t already cached.
  - 4️⃣ It compiles all dependencies first, and then your project.

- The first time `cargo build` is run, all the dependencies are downloaded and compiled:

  ```rust
    Updating crates.io index
    Locking 15 packages to latest Rust 1.85.0 compatible versions
      Adding rand v0.8.5 (available: v0.9.0)
  Compiling proc-macro2 v1.0.93
  Compiling unicode-ident v1.0.17
  Compiling libc v0.2.170
  Compiling cfg-if v1.0.0
  Compiling byteorder v1.5.0
  Compiling getrandom v0.2.15
  Compiling rand_core v0.6.4
  Compiling quote v1.0.38
  Compiling syn v2.0.98
  Compiling zerocopy-derive v0.7.35
  Compiling zerocopy v0.7.35
  Compiling ppv-lite86 v0.2.20
  Compiling rand_chacha v0.3.1
  Compiling rand v0.8.5
  Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.48s
  ```

  If `cargo build` is typed again, and no changed has happened:
  
  ```rust
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
  ```

  If a change is made in `main.rs` and then `cargo build`

  ```rust
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (/Users/apple/github_repos/learning-rust/projects/guessing_game)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.92s
  ```

## ☀️ 8th November - Saturday

- `cargo update` will update dependencies, up to next version. For example, if the version in the `Cargo.toml` is 0.8.5 then using `cargo update` will update all the version (if any) till but not including 0.9.

- When you declare variables at the beginning of the code, they could be modules, traits, struct etc. For example:

  ```rust
  use rand::Rng;
  use std::io;
  use std::cmp::Ordering;
  ```

  If it's in PascalCase then it could be a `trait`, `struct` or `Enum`. Lowercase is a `module`. `Rng` is a trait.

  Ordering is a enum whose variants are:
  - `Greater`
  - `Less`
  - `Equal`

- Rust defaults to `i32`  

- Very important command is `cargo doc --open` which builds the documentation of all the dependencies locally and open it in the browser. Cool!

- Rust allows users to do *shadowing*. Shadowing means that a variable name can be reused instead of creating a new name.

- Moving from an `expect` to a `match` makes possible to move from crashing to handling error. Examples below:
  
  ```rust
  let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
  ```

  ```rust
  let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
          Ok(num) => num,
          Err(_) => continue,
      };
  ```
